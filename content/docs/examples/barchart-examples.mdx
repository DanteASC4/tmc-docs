# `barchart`

Loads of examples!

Just a reminder that currently `barchart` returns and SVG, so to use the output you'll want to add it to the DOM however your framework of choice handles it.

```ts
const myChart = barchart({
  data: [50, 100, 30],
});

if (myChart) document.body.appendChild(myChart);
```

For brevity, I'll show just the function calls!

## From Quick Start

The most basic possible usage:

```ts
barchart({
  data: [50, 100, 30],
});
```

Adding some labels:

```ts
barchart({
  data: [50, 100, 30],
  labels: ['1st', '2nd', '3rd'],
});
```

![Second intro chart, with labels](/imgs/intro-c2.svg)

And let's place it on the top:

```ts
barchart({
  data: [50, 100, 30],
  labels: ['1st', '2nd', '3rd'],
  placement: 'top',
});
```

## Larger Data Values

If one bar is far larger than the others, the resulting zoomed out to fit the largest bar, showing a sense of scale.

```ts
barchart({
  data: [50, 1000, 100],
  placement: 'left',
});
```

Placed on the top:

```ts
barchart({
  data: [50, 1000, 100],
  placement: 'top',
});
```

## Coloring

Adding colors is straightforward too!

### Basic Coloring

Below only `2` colors are provided, but `3` datapoints are given.

```ts
barchart({
  data: [100, 50, 100],
  placement: 'top',
  colors: ['#ff00ff', '#00ffff'],
});
```

### Gradients

Providing a few colors in the `gradientColors` array will result in each bar getting a linear gradient with evenly spaced stops based on the number of colors given.

In the below example I've set the resulting SVG's height & width to be the same as datapoints to show the colored bars.

```ts
barchart({
  data: [100, 100, 100],
  placement: 'left',
  gradientColors: ['#ff00ff', '#00ffff'],
  gradientDirection: 'left-to-right',
  width: 110,
  height: 110,
});
```

The linear gradient that's created automatically spreads the color stops evenly, from the start of the array of colors to the end. So giving it two colors like above results in stops like so:

```
magenta           cyan
0%                100%
<------------------->
```

The nice thing is that any valid CSS color should work, here's an example using `oklch` instead:

```ts
barchart({
  data: [100, 50, 100],
  placement: 'top',
  gradientColors: [
    'oklch(0.7017 0.3225 328.36)',
    'oklch(0.9054 0.15455 194.769)',
  ],
  gradientDirection: 'top-to-bottom',
});
```

And another thing I added that I think is pretty cool is having a continuous gradient that's created with a bit of masking!

To do this the `gradientMode` should be `"continuos"` & the `gradientDirection` can be whatever way you want it, here I've set it to match the top-side bar placement.

```ts
barchart({
  data: [250, 50, 100, 150, 100],
  placement: 'top',
  gradientColors: [
    'oklch(0.7017 0.3225 328.36)',
    'oklch(0.9054 0.15455 194.769)',
  ],
  gradientDirection: 'top-to-bottom',
  gradientMode: 'continuous',
});
```

## Animation

Because toomanycharts outputs SVG elements, they can be animated! The <u className="text-purple-500 font-bold">caveat</u> is that to animate the individual bars, depending on what sort of animation you want to do, you'll need to change the `transform-origin` for bars after the charts created based on which side they're on. Which sounds more complicated than it is!

### Animejs

Let's look at an example, where to have the bars 'grow in' we'll need to do exactly that. I'll use my animation engine lib of choice - [animejs](https://animejs.com/documentation/getting-started)!

```ts tab="main.ts" lineNumbers
// main.ts
import BasicChart from './script';
import './style.css';

const app = document.querySelector<HTMLDivElement>('#app')!;
const addMyChart = BasicChart();
app.appendChild(addMyChart);
```

```ts tab="script.ts" lineNumbers
// script.ts
import { animate, utils } from 'animejs';
import { barchart } from 'toomanycharts';

const growBars = () => {
  utils.set('.el-bar', {
    transformOrigin: 'left center',
    scaleX: 0,
  });

  animate('.el-bar', {
    scaleX: 1,
    duration: 2000,
    ease: 'linear',
  });
};

export default function BasicChart() {
  const basic = barchart({
    data: [50, 100, 30],
    barClass: 'el-bar',
    placement: 'left',
  });

  setTimeout(() => {
    growBars();
  }, 100);
  return basic;
}
```

Results in:

<iframe
  height="400"
  width="400"
  src="/example-pages/barchart-animejs/index.html"></iframe>

#### Breakdown

`main.ts` is just appending the chart to the page.

`script.ts` does a few things, here's a commented version of it:

```ts tab="script.ts" lineNumbers
// imports omitted

// Helper function that does the "setup" and then calls the animation itself
const growBars = () => {
  /*
  animejs provide some nice utilities for manipulating the DOM in this kind of way, which I'm using here to set some of the above mentioned properties before the animating begins

  Breakdown:
    1. I'm targeting ".el-bar" as animejs allows for class selectors (among others) as the target.
    2. Because I've set the bars to be on the left down below, the `transform-origin` for the bars needs to moved to the left of each bar.
    3. Setting the scaleX to 0 as a 'starting point' of what will be changing
  */
  utils.set('.el-bar', {
    transformOrigin: 'left center', // [!code highlight]
    scaleX: 0,
  });

  // Similar to above but this is the actual animation call itself
  animate('.el-bar', {
    scaleX: 1,
    duration: 2000,
    ease: 'linear',
  });
};

export default function BasicChart() {
  // Notice the `barClass` option!
  const basic = barchart({
    data: [50, 100, 30],
    barClass: 'el-bar', // [!code highlight]
    placement: 'left',
  });

  // This is justDelay the animation until after the element actually exists in the page.
  // It could be a mutationObserver, or intersectionObserver, or some other method of calling `growBars` after the SVG is in the page.
  setTimeout(() => {
    growBars();
  }, 100);
  return basic;
}
```

<Callout title="Flicker" type="warn">

You may have noticed that there's a bit of a 'flicker' above - this is a known issue. It happens because the order of things as it currently stands, which goes something like:

- Page loads
- Chart created, added to page
  - At this point it looks normal with all bars full-width
- `100ms` after, `scaleX` set to `0` so now the bars are suddenly gone, causing a flicker

The fix here is simple, and coming soon. I will add a `barStyle` option which will allow you to set inline styles for each bar, which'll get tacked onto them - avoiding the flicker.

</Callout>

All that being said, the `transform-origin` is only relevant when you're moving the bars in some way, something like `opacity` or `fill` wouldn't require that at all.

#### `transformOrigin` guide

Regardless, here's a table & visual guide for all placement options!

| placement | `transformOrigin` keywords |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| "top"     | "top center"               |
| "right"   | "right center"             |
| "bottom"  | "bottom center"            |
| "left"    | "left center"              |
