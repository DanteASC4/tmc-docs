# Quick Start

Getting your first chart as soon as possible!

## Installation

```bash tab="npm"
npm install toomanycharts
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm install toomanycharts
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add toomanycharts
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun install toomanycharts
```

```bash tab="deno"
deno install jsr:@toomanycharts/toomanycharts
```

## Usage

All that's needed to create a simple bar chart:

```ts
const myChart = barchart({
  data: [50, 100, 30],
});

if (myChart) document.body.appendChild(myChart);
```

Will result in a chart like so:

![The First Chart](/imgs/intro-c1.svg)

<span className="text-xs italic">
  Ironically, not inlined here (as of now) because turbopack was complaining
  about it causing a hydration mismatch.
</span>

### Keep Going

Add some labels:

```ts
barchart({
  data: [50, 100, 30],
  labels: ['1st', '2nd', '3rd'],
});
```

![Second intro chart, with labels](/imgs/intro-c2.svg)

Place it on the top instead:

```ts
barchart({
  data: [50, 100, 30],
  labels: ['1st', '2nd', '3rd'],
  placement: 'top',
});
```
